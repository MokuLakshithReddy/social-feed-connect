## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 1. 🏛️ Club-Specific Workspaces
Every student organization has its own private community with four distinct spaces so information never gets lost in chat noise:
* **📢 Official Announcements**: Read-only broadcasting space where authorized club organizers publish notices and meeting agendas.
* **💬 Community Discussion**: Real-time group chat for members to discuss ideas, share resources, and collaborate.
* **🚀 Project Rooms**: Dedicated team spaces for students developing club projects (e.g. hackathon teams, rover builds).
* **📅 Club Events & Workshops**: Scheduled activities, registrations, and venue details specific to the club.
* **👥 Member Directory**: Verified directory categorizing club presidents, coordinators, and active members.

### 2. 📅 Unified Campus Events & Digital Passes
* **Campus-Wide Event Calendar**: Browse workshops, fests, hackathons, and guest lectures across all college clubs.
* **1-Click Registration & Capacity Limits**: Real-time attendance caps prevent overbooking.
* **🎟️ Digital QR Attendance Pass**: Generates a secure, unique QR pass for every registered attendee to enable fast on-site check-in.

### 3. 🎓 Verified Student Identity
* **College Identity Card**: Student profiles show verified badges, academic department, study year, and student roll number.
* **Club Roster**: Displays a student's active clubs, leadership roles, and registered event passes in one place.

### 4. 🛡️ Role-Based Security & Permissions
Enforced strictly at the PostgreSQL database level using **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
* **College Administrators**: Oversee college settings and verify student organizations.
* **Club Presidents & Organizers**: Appoint leads, broadcast official notices, schedule events, and moderate discussions.
* **Club Members**: Chat, participate in discussions, register for workshops, and access resources.
* **Students**: Discover public club profiles, submit membership requests, and view the campus calendar.
